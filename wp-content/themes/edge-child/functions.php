// note: sometimes this doesn't work, and to fix it, The easiest way to fix this is to have WordPress reset the permalinks. So, I will go to the Settings menu and click on Permalinks.
// I will then change the permalinks setting from Day and Name to Month and Name, although it really doesnâ€™t matter which one I choose.
// I will then hit Save Changes, and then I will go back to my test case study and hit refresh. And, sure enough, there it is.
